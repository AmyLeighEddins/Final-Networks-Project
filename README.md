A.     Status of code:
 	Our code works and functions as specified. The python code is only compatible with Python 2.7 not 3.0.
 
B.     How to compile and execute our code:
	All code is compiled and executed from the Linux command line.
 
	Compilation
            UDPServer.c: gcc UDPServer.c –o server
            (UDPClient is a Python program and does not need to be compiled.)

            UDPClient.py: python UDPClient.py servername portNumber reqID hostName1 hostName2 hostName3 …
            UDPServer.c: ./server portNumber
